# ResNet-56
Implementation of the ResNet-56 (Residual Network) architecture using PyTorch on Google Colab, designed for image classification tasks with deep neural networks. This project demonstrates the implementation of ResNet-56, a variant of the Residual Neural Network (ResNet) introduced in the 2015 paper "Deep Residual Learning for Image Recognition" by Kaiming He et al. ResNet revolutionized deep learning by introducing residual connections (skip connections), enabling efficient training of very deep networks and addressing the vanishing gradient problem. Built with PyTorch and executed on Google Colab, the project leverages GPU acceleration for efficient training and evaluation, commonly applied to datasets like CIFAR-10.
